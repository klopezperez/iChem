    """Implements the BBReal clustering algorithm for online clustering of molecular trajectories.
    
    BBReal combines a BIRCH CF-tree with RMSD-calibrated merge decisions to provide
    simple and physically interpretable clustering. The algorithm performs online clustering
    in a single pass, maintaining a clear guarantee that the average distance to the
    centroid of each cluster remains within the chosen tolerance throughout the process.
    
    For each new frame insertion, the algorithm evaluates the candidate cluster after
    hypothetical inclusion of the new frame. If the merge satisfies the bound implied
    by the threshold, the frame is accepted and the clustering features are updated.
    This approach is memory-bounded, fast, and enables efficient assignment of frames
    in an incremental operation with clusters that are easy to explain.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float, default=1.0
        The RMSD tolerance threshold for cluster membership. This serves as an intuitive
        control for granularity: increasing threshold reduces the number of clusters,
        concentrates coverage in the largest states, and broadens within-cluster RMSD
        distributions. The threshold represents the actual physical tolerance and provides
        interpretable choices for clustering resolution.

    branching_factor : int, default=1024
        Maximum number of subclusters in each node. When a new sample would cause
        a node to exceed this limit, the node is split into two nodes with subclusters
        redistributed between them. The parent subcluster is removed and two new
        subclusters are added as parents of the split nodes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    root_ : _BFNode
        Root of the BF Tree.

    dummy_leaf_ : _BFNode
        Start pointer to all the leaves.

    subcluster_centers_ : ndarray
        Centroids of all subclusters read directly from the leaves.

    index_tracker : int
        Counter tracking the current frame/molecule index.

    first_call : bool
        Flag indicating if this is the first call to fit.

    Notes
    -----
    The tree data structure consists of nodes with each node containing a number of
    subclusters. The maximum number of subclusters in a node is determined by the
    branching factor. Each subcluster maintains a linear sum, squared sum, molecule
    indices, and the number of samples in that subcluster. Additionally, each
    subcluster can have a child node if it is not a member of a leaf node.

    For a new point entering the root, it is merged with the closest subcluster
    and the linear sum, molecule indices, and sample count are updated. This process
    continues recursively until the properties of the leaf node are updated.

        This method extracts all current subclusters from the tree, resets it,
        optionally increases the threshold, and refits all subclusters. This can
        help reduce the number of singleton clusters by giving them another chance
        to merge with existing clusters under potentially more relaxed conditions.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        iterations : int, default=1
            The maximum number of refinement iterations to perform.
            
        extra_threshold : float, default=0.0
            The amount to increase the current threshold in each iteration.
            Increasing the threshold makes the merge criterion more permissive,
            allowing more subclusters to merge.
            
        shuffle : bool, default=False
            Whether to shuffle the order of subclusters before reinsertion.
            Shuffling can help avoid systematic biases in the clustering order.
            
        seed : int or None, default=None
            Random seed for shuffling. Only used if shuffle=True.
            
        verbose : bool, default=False
            Whether to print progress information during reclustering.
            
        stop_early : bool, default=False
            Whether to stop iterations early if no singletons remain or if
            the number of singletons hasn't changed since the last iteration.

        Notes
        -----
        - This method extracts BitFeatures directly as tuples (n_samples_, linear_sum_, sq_sum, mol_indices)
          from all leaf subclusters before resetting and refitting the tree.
        - Singleton clusters (clusters with only 1 sample) are particularly likely
          to find better matches during reclustering, especially when threshold is increased.
        - The order of reinsertion can affect the final clustering, which is why
          the shuffle parameter is provided.
        - The method preserves all clustering features (linear_sum_, sq_sum, mol_indices)
          from the previous clustering without creating unnecessary intermediate objects.
